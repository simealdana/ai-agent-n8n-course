# Hybrid Pattern

The Hybrid Pattern combines elements of both Single Agent and Multi-Agent patterns, along with traditional automation workflows. This approach provides flexibility and efficiency by using the right tool for each part of the process.

## Key Characteristics

- **Mixed Approach**: Combines AI agents with traditional automation
- **Flexible Architecture**: Can adapt to different parts of the workflow
- **Optimized Resource Usage**: Uses AI only where needed
- **Scalable Design**: Can grow from simple to complex implementations

## Use Cases

- Complex business processes
- Mixed automation and decision-making tasks
- Legacy system integration
- Resource-constrained environments
- Gradual AI adoption

## Implementation Example

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "type": "Traditional Automation",
      "parameters": {
        "task": "Data Collection"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "AI Agent",
      "parameters": {
        "systemMessage": "You are an analysis agent...",
        "tools": ["tool1", "tool2"]
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "Traditional Automation",
      "parameters": {
        "task": "Result Processing"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Identify which parts of the workflow need AI capabilities
2. Use traditional automation for well-defined, repetitive tasks
3. Implement clear handoffs between AI and traditional components
4. Monitor performance of both AI and traditional components
5. Maintain clear documentation of the hybrid system

## Limitations

- Requires careful system design
- More complex testing requirements
- Potential integration challenges
- Need for specialized maintenance
- Higher initial setup complexity
