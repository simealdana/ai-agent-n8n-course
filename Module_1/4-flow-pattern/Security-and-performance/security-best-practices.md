# Security Best Practices for AI Agents

This guide outlines essential security practices for implementing and maintaining AI agents in your workflows.

## Authentication and Authorization

- Implement strong authentication for all API endpoints
- Use role-based access control (RBAC)
- Regularly rotate API keys and credentials
- Implement rate limiting and request validation
- Use secure session management

## Data Protection

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Implement proper data sanitization
- Use secure storage solutions
- Follow data retention policies
- Implement data backup and recovery procedures

## API Security

- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Implement API key management
- Use OAuth 2.0 for authentication
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Use API versioning

## Agent Security

- Implement input validation
- Use secure prompt engineering
- Monitor agent behavior
- Implement output validation
- Use secure memory management

## Infrastructure Security

- Keep all dependencies updated
- Use secure configuration management
- Implement network security measures
- Use secure deployment practices
- Regular security audits
