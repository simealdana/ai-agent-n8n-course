# Common AI Agent Flow Patterns in n8n

## Introduction
Advanced n8n users and researchers have identified several design patterns for AI agent workflows. These patterns increase in complexity and capability, from simple AI task sequences to autonomous agent teams. Let's explore four key patterns adapted for n8n, explaining their structure, advantages, and use cases.

## Pattern 1: Chained Requests

### Structure
- Linear sequence of three or more connected agents/stages
- Output from each step feeds into the next
- Resembles a rigid pipeline
- Predefined AI actions executed in fixed order

### Example Implementation
```javascript
// Example: Audio Processing Pipeline
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "type": "Audio Transcription",
      "input": "audio_file",
      "output": "transcribed_text"
    },
    {
      "type": "OpenAI",
      "input": "transcribed_text",
      "output": "summary"
    },
    {
      "type": "Database",
      "input": "summary",
      "output": "stored_summary"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Benefits
- Complete and predictable control over the process
- Each stage can be fine-tuned and tested independently
- Allows use of different specialized models for each subtask
- Scalable - can add more steps as task complexity grows

### When to Use
- When the problem can be clearly divided into separate, well-defined steps
- For multi-modal processes (e.g., audio to text to image)
- When each transformation is necessary and sequential

### Considerations
- Limited adaptability to unexpected situations
- Requires careful output format management between stages
- Error handling needed between stages

## Pattern 2: Single Agent

### Structure
- One central AI agent controlling the entire flow
- Maintains state and makes all decisions
- Access to multiple tools and working memory
- Dynamic decision-making capabilities

### Example Implementation
```javascript
// Example: Customer Service Agent
{
  "agent": {
    "type": "AI Agent",
    "memory": "Simple Memory",
    "tools": [
      "Database Query",
      "Email Sender",
      "Report Generator"
    ],
    "capabilities": [
      "Context maintenance",
      "Tool selection",
      "Multi-step planning"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Benefits
- Flexible and adaptive compared to rigid sequences
- Maintains unified context
- Simpler to implement and debug
- Single interface for multiple tasks

### When to Use
- For chatbots and personal assistants
- When a single interface is needed
- For tasks requiring moderate autonomy

### Considerations
- Must provide all necessary tools and data
- Memory management is crucial
- Error handling and fallbacks are essential

## Pattern 3: Multi-Agent with Gatekeeper

### Structure
- Hierarchical organization
- Main agent (gatekeeper) coordinates specialized sub-agents
- Delegates tasks based on expertise
- Integrates responses into coherent output

### Example Implementation
```javascript
// Example: Customer Support System
{
  "gatekeeper": {
    "type": "AI Agent",
    "role": "Coordinator",
    "sub_agents": [
      {
        "type": "Technical Support Agent",
        "expertise": "Technical issues"
      },
      {
        "type": "Billing Agent",
        "expertise": "Financial matters"
      },
      {
        "type": "Knowledge Base Agent",
        "expertise": "Information retrieval"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Benefits
- Combines centralized control with distributed expertise
- Each agent can be optimized for specific tasks
- Handles complex processes through decomposition
- Scalable - can add new specialized agents

### When to Use
- For complex customer support systems
- When tasks span multiple domains
- When control and filtering are needed

### Considerations
- Clear communication protocols needed
- Error handling at multiple levels
- Complex memory management
- Monitoring and debugging challenges

## Pattern 4: Multi-Agent Teams

### Structure
- Multiple AI agents operating collaboratively
- Decentralized or hybrid organization
- Possible parallel execution
- Various topologies: mesh, multi-level hierarchy, hybrid

### Example Implementation
```javascript
// Example: Software Project Team
{
  "team": {
    "project_manager": {
      "role": "Coordination",
      "subordinates": ["programmer", "tester", "documenter"]
    },
    "programmer": {
      "role": "Development",
      "peers": ["tester"]
    },
    "tester": {
      "role": "Quality Assurance",
      "peers": ["programmer"]
    },
    "documenter": {
      "role": "Documentation"
    }
  }
}
```

### Benefits
- Maximum flexibility and scalability
- Parallel task execution
- Integration of different AI models
- Creative problem-solving through agent collaboration

### When to Use
- Complex organizational systems
- Large-scale AI solutions
- Experimental multi-agent systems

### Considerations
- High complexity in design and maintenance
- Clear communication protocols essential
- Task assignment and conflict resolution needed
- Comprehensive monitoring required

## Pattern Comparison

| Pattern | Structure | Autonomy Level | Typical Use Cases |
|---------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Chained Requests | Multiple AI/LLM nodes in fixed sequence | No adaptive autonomy | Multi-stage processes, format conversion |
| Single Agent | One agent node orchestrating tools | Moderate autonomy | Chatbots, personal assistants |
| Multi-Agent (Gatekeeper) | Main agent delegating to specialists | High autonomy with central control | Customer support, multi-function assistants |
| Multi-Agent Teams | Multiple collaborating agents | Very high distributed autonomy | Large-scale AI solutions, enterprise systems |

## Best Practices

### 1. Memory and State Management
- Implement memory for context and planning
- Use Simple Memory node for basic state tracking
- Consider shared memory for agent teams
- Maintain session IDs for continuity

### 2. Flow Control
- Use loops and conditional logic
- Implement explicit iteration cycles
- Add human-in-the-loop checkpoints
- Structure complex tasks into manageable steps

### 3. Prompt Engineering
- Define clear agent roles and objectives
- Specify available resources and tools
- Set expected output formats
- Include usage patterns and limitations

### 4. Error Handling
- Implement verification tools
- Use vector stores for factual data
- Set step limits
- Add fallback mechanisms

### 5. Scalability
- Use appropriate models for different roles
- Implement parallel execution
- Create reusable sub-workflows
- Monitor performance and resource usage

## Conclusion
The choice of pattern depends on your specific needs and the complexity of your task. Sometimes a simple linear sequence is more effective than an overly complex "intelligent" solution, while other times a team of specialized agents is necessary. By following these patterns and best practices, you can create robust, scalable, and maintainable AI agent workflows in n8n.
