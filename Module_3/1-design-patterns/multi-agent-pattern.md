# Multi-Agent Pattern

The Multi-Agent Pattern involves multiple AI agents working together to accomplish complex tasks. Each agent has specific responsibilities and can communicate with other agents to achieve the overall goal.

## Key Characteristics

- **Multiple Specialized Agents**: Different agents handle different aspects of the task
- **Inter-Agent Communication**: Agents can share information and coordinate actions
- **Distributed Decision Making**: Decisions are made across multiple agents
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents can work simultaneously

## Use Cases

- Complex project management
- Multi-step data processing
- Collaborative content creation
- Distributed problem solving
- Large-scale automation tasks

## Implementation Example

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "type": "Coordinator Agent",
      "parameters": {
        "systemMessage": "You are the coordinator agent...",
        "subAgents": ["agent1", "agent2", "agent3"]
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "Specialized Agent 1",
      "parameters": {
        "systemMessage": "You are specialized in task X...",
        "tools": ["tool1", "tool2"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Clearly define each agent's role and responsibilities
2. Implement robust communication protocols between agents
3. Use a coordinator agent when necessary
4. Monitor inter-agent communication
5. Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Limitations

- Increased complexity in implementation
- Potential communication overhead
- More difficult to debug and maintain
- Requires careful coordination
- Higher resource consumption
