# Single Agent Pattern

The Single Agent Pattern is the most straightforward approach to implementing AI agents in your workflows. In this pattern, a single AI agent drives the entire workflow, maintaining state and making all decisions from start to finish.

## Key Characteristics

- **Single Decision Maker**: One AI agent controls the entire workflow
- **State Management**: The agent maintains context throughout the process
- **Tool Usage**: The agent can use multiple tools but makes all decisions
- **Direct Interaction**: The agent interacts directly with the user or system

## Use Cases

- Simple task automation
- Customer service interactions
- Content generation
- Data analysis and reporting
- Basic decision-making workflows

## Implementation Example

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "type": "AI Agent",
      "parameters": {
        "systemMessage": "You are a task automation agent...",
        "tools": ["tool1", "tool2", "tool3"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Keep the agent's responsibilities focused and well-defined
2. Provide clear system messages and context
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Monitor agent performance and behavior
5. Use appropriate tools for the task at hand

## Limitations

- Limited scalability for complex tasks
- Single point of failure
- May become overwhelmed with too many responsibilities
- Limited parallel processing capabilities
